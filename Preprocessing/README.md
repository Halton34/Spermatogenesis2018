# Scripts to process the data for analysis

To recreate the preprocessing done in the paper run the scripts in following order:

* Basic quality control and filtering script located in [QualityControl](../../master/Preprocessing/QualityControl/).

* The clustering script to detect cell types in B6 located in [Clustering](../../master/Preprocessing/Clustering/) ([CellTypesB6.Rmd](../../master/Preprocessing/Clustering/CellTypesB6.Rmd))

* Script that perform subclustering on enriched cell populations located in [Clustering](../../master/Preprocessing/Clustering/).
